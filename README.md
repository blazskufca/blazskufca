# About Me
Hello! My name is Blaz, and I am an aspiring developer with a passion for Python and Java.

### *Projects*
Here are a few of the projects I have worked on:

### *[Trackify](https://github.com/blazskufca/Trackify)*
Trackify is a web application that allows users to track prices of items and products across multiple online retailers (mostly focused on Slovenian retailers, although Amazon.de is supported too). This project was built using Python, Django, and JavaScript, and it utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store data. The repository also includes a Docker setup for deployment. Some of the features of Trackify include:

- Simple and friendly UI
- Grpahical representation of price movements
- Registration and saving of items into user profiles

- - -

### *[Sentiment Predictions with Naive Bayes Models](https://github.com/blazskufca/Sentiment-predictions-with-Naive-Bayes-models)*
In this project, I explored the use of Naive Bayes models to predict the sentiment of news headlines. I used the Manually Sentiment Annotated Slovenian News Corpus SentiNews 1.0 to train and test my models. Some of the techniques I used include:

- TF-IDF vectorizer
- Pandas library for corpus analysis and cleanup
- Seaborn library for graphical representation of dataset and model accuracy (confusion matrix)
- Scikit-learn and their Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers
